* Radiography Processing with the Cyclotron
This is a set of tools for processing data from radiographic
measurements with the proton cyclotron at MIT. 

These tools were used to analyze experimental data for my Master's
thesis in cargo radiography and active interrogation. I will include a
link to the thesis once it is published on DSpace. 

* Tools
** On-Axis Processing
This C++ tool takes a ROOT data file (time sorted) and processes a
digitizer channel for an on-axis detector. It produces a calibrated
histogram, PSD plot, pileup corrected histogram, and a pileup cut
(TCutG). For more information, use the "-h/--help" option when running
the program.

To build, go into the directory and type the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
make
make clean
#+END_SRC

To learn more about using the program:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
./charon_onaxis --help
#+END_SRC
